## üìã Problem Statement

Climate change is the defining challenge of our time, but individual action remains fragmented and ineffective due to:

### Core Problems:
1. **Information Overload**: Climate data is scattered across multiple sources, making it difficult for individuals to understand their impact
2. **Lack of Personalization**: Generic advice doesn't account for location, lifestyle, or personal circumstances
3. **Action Paralysis**: People want to help but don't know where to start or what actions are most effective
4. **No Impact Tracking**: Individuals can't measure their environmental impact or see progress over time
5. **Disconnected Communities**: Climate action happens in isolation without community support or motivation

### Target Customer Experience:
**Sarah, a 32-year-old marketing professional in Denver, wants to reduce her carbon footprint but feels overwhelmed by conflicting information and doesn't know which actions will have the biggest impact for her specific situation.**

---

## üöÄ Solution Statement

Climate Guardian solves these problems through an integrated AI platform that:

### Key Features:
1. **Personalized AI Assistant**: Uses IBM watsonx.ai with RAG to provide tailored climate advice based on user profile, location, and goals
2. **Real-Time Data Integration**: Connects to 7+ APIs (Climate TRACE, World Bank, UN SDG, NASA POWER) for current climate intelligence
3. **Impact Tracking**: Quantifies environmental impact with equivalent metrics (trees planted, miles not driven)
4. **Interactive Visualizations**: Advanced maps and charts showing global climate data and local renewable energy potential
5. **Community Features**: Leaderboards and challenges to motivate collective action
6. **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific, measurable actions with cost-benefit analysis

### Customer Experience Transformation:
**Sarah now receives personalized recommendations for Denver's climate, tracks her 2.5-ton annual CO2 reduction, and connects with 1,200+ community members taking similar actions. She knows exactly which actions provide the biggest impact for her $1,500 budget.**

### Technical Innovation:
- **RAG-Enhanced AI**: Combines IBM watsonx.ai with real-time climate data for contextual responses
- **Multi-API Integration**: Seamlessly aggregates data from global climate databases
- **Advanced Analytics**: Converts complex climate data into actionable personal insights
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports thousands of users with personalized experiences

## ü§ñ RAG and IBM watsonx.ai Implementation

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Architecture

Our RAG system enhances IBM watsonx.ai with real-time climate knowledge:

#### 1. Knowledge Base Construction
```python
# Real-time data extraction from multiple sources
class ClimateDataExtractor:
    def extract_world_bank_data(self):
        # Extracts climate indicators for 10+ countries
        # CO2 emissions, renewable energy %, forest coverage
    
    def extract_climate_trace_data(self):
        # Real emissions data from Climate TRACE API
        # Country-level greenhouse gas emissions
    
    def extract_un_sdg_data(self):
        # UN Sustainable Development Goals climate targets
        # SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 7 (Clean Energy)
    
    def extract_nasa_climate_data(self):
        # Renewable energy potential from NASA POWER
        # Solar irradiance and wind speed data
```

#### 2. Vector Database Integration
```python
# ChromaDB for semantic search
class ClimateRAGSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = chromadb.Client()
        self.collection = self.client.create_collection(
            name="climate_knowledge",
            embedding_function=SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction()
        )
    
    def search_knowledge(self, query: str, n_results: int = 5):
        # Semantic search through climate knowledge base
        results = self.collection.query(
            query_texts=[query],
            n_results=n_results
        )
        return results
```

#### 3. IBM watsonx.ai Integration
```python
# watsonx.ai client for enhanced responses
class WatsonXClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.credentials = {
            "url": "https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
            "apikey": "DEpIQ-eBB6HNdayC-T82ejY2FPbP2arw1jlk0ubv89Cs"
        }
        self.model = ModelInference(
            model_id="ibm/granite-13b-chat-v2",
            credentials=self.credentials
        )
    
    def generate_response(self, prompt: str, context: str):
        # Enhanced prompt with RAG context
        enhanced_prompt = f"""
        Context: {context}
        User Query: {prompt}
        
        Provide personalized climate action advice based on the context.
        """
        return self.model.generate_text(enhanced_prompt)
```
